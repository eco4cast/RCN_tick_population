### Script to create tidy dataset of NEON tick abundances 
### To be used for the RCN Tick Forecasting Challenge 
# Tick Data
# link data from lab and field
# filter out poor quality data
# rectify count issues
# only included training data 
# through end of 2018
# I. scaularis and A. amercanum nymphs
# target plots
# Environmental drivers
# subset to target variables
# define uncertainties
# merge with tick data
# export a .csv

### Load packages
# devtools::install_github("NEONScience/NEON-utilities/neonUtilities")
# library(neonUtilities) # for downloading data (use GitHub version)

# library(usethis)

library(tidyverse) # for data wrangling and piping (dplyr probably ok)
library(lubridate) # for finding year from dates
library(stringr) # for searching within character strings 
library(here) # for working within subdirectories

# NOTES ON GENERAL DATA ISSUES #
###########################################

# Issue 1: the latency between field (30 days) and lab (300 days) is different
# In 2019, tick counts were switched over to the lab instead of the field
# If the samples aren't processed yet, there will be an NA for all the counts (regardless of whether ticks were present)
# Normally if ticks weren't present (targetTaxaPresent == "N) we could feel comfortable assigning all the tick counts a 0 (no ticks)
# In this case, doing that would mean that there are 0s when ticks are absent and NAs when ticks are present
# Yearly trends would show a bias since there are no counts for all the sites with ticks, and 0s when there aren't ticks
# Rather, we should not use those dates until the lab data come in
# Would be good to check with NEON whether the 0s for counts are assigned at the same time the lab data come in?

# Issue 2: larva counts
# larvae were not always counted or ID'd in earlier years
# requiring larval counts to be non-NA will remove records from earlier years

# Issue 3: discrepancies between field counts and lab counts
# Often lab counts are less than field because they stop counting at a certain limit
# This is not always recorded in the same way
# Other times ticks were miscounted or lost on either end
# Probably OK to ignore most minor issues, and make best attempt at more major issues
# Drop remaining records that are confusing

# note that some of these could have a "most likely" ID assigned based on what the majority of IDs are
# for now don't attempt to assign. 
# the user can decide what to do with the IXOSP2 later (e.g. assign to lower taxonomy)
# from this point on, trust lab rather than field counts because lab were corrected if discrepancy exists
